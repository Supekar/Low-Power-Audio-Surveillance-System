# Low-Power-Audio-Surveillance-System

The Low Power Audio Surveillance System is made up of many ArduinoDue Boards. It has primarily two parts, the sender and the receiver.
1) Sender: the sender is tasked with extracting the information of the two freuqencies of signals present in the audio signal. It is able to distinguish the two audio signals from the noise present in the signal. The sender extracts the required information, encodes it and sends it to the receiver side using LoRa Radio.
2) The receiver side receives the signal from LoRa radio. It must correctly receive the proper information from the receied signal amidst the interference generated by another ArduinoDue board. It extracts the decodes the information of the two frequencies and sends it to the server connected to it.
